<p>Because <a href="http://entermediasoftware.com">EnterMedia</a> Digital Asset Management is open source, we try to share the different projects we are working on. If we weren't such shy people, we would share even more!</p>
<p>Like, did you even know we went to LA for Createasphere? Or we have a new connector for Rhozet, Drupal (Kudo's for DPCI for this one!), or Joomla? Probably not... Sorry, I digress...!</p>
<p>Here's a project we have been busy with, an interface for an application, code named MediaLab.</p>
<p>Our design team is creating an interface for a new EnterMedia application, MediaLab. To explain, EnterMedia server is where all the administrative functions take place. An 'application', which is used with EnterMedia, is where features are created and happen.</p>
<p>MediaLab is an advanced concept for working with digital media, of all types. It's a powerful tool that enhances the collaboration and approval process of digital media production, management and workflow. This is for work in progress and archiving of digital files and can be used in small and enterprise environments.</p>
<p>Every digital file has an Activity, which is anything that is happening, needs to happen or has happened to a digital file or files. So an Activity could be editing, sharing, downloading, uploading, etc., of one or more assets. Activities are automated and tracked, so you can monitor what is happening to your digital files at any given time.</p>
<p>You can also create Projects but not all digital files need to be part of a Project. It's up to you as the admin to decide if a digital file should be part of a project. This allows EnterMedia to remain flexible, as an open source software should be.</p>
<p>You can see the screenshots of MediaLab posted on our<a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/EnterMedia/121544607860643"> Facebook</a> page.</p>
<p>As I eavesdrop on our programming and design teams, I'll be able to share more! Let us know what you think.</p>
