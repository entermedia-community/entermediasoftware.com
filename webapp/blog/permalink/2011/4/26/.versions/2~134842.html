<p>Recently I came across this cool blog posting which compares EnterMedia with Kaltura. http://bh.cl.sl.pt</p>
<p>I have re-posted it here:</p>
<p>So the big question is which one is better.</p>
<p>Well, that would be like asking which is better, Oranges or Apples.</p>
<p>There are some instances where you would not use oranges to make an apple pie or add apples to orange juice.</p>
<p>OK, maybe apples in your orange juice is ok, if you like that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But back to which one is better Kaltura or Entermedia. Well, they  overlap each other in some areas but they really are exceptional in  their own execution of services and what they can provide.<br />
Entermedia is primarily an Open Source Digital Asset Management (DAM)  system.  What does this mean&hellip;  it means in a nutshell  that you will be  able to have all your assets like video, images and audio available in  one place that can be quickly and easily accessed and searched for use  in creation of other media or projects like print, flyers or web  development.  Think of it as a depository like you would when using  Expression Media Reader.</p>
<p>We will shortly get into where Entermedia and Kaltura overlap.</p>
<p>Now Kaltura.</p>
<p>Kaltura is an OPEN SOURCE VIDEO PLATFORM DELIVERY SYSTEM.  What this  means is that it is built for delivery of content to your website and  allow you to edit, develop customization, analytical tracking and  control of how the public consumes the content. Both platforms are free  and open to all, meaning no license fees, no worry or issues with  modification of the code to fit your needs, enhancements are encouraged  and rewarded with credit by both companies.</p>
<p>So where is the overlap?  What is the difference?  Let&rsquo;s first go into the overlap.</p>
<p>Both allow you to control and manage your content.  You can upload  files, video, images and even sound files.  Both allow you to quickly  and easily embed these assets into your sites by simply &ldquo;copying and  paste&rdquo; methods.</p>
<p>Both are used by major companies and universities.</p>
<p>Entermedia and Kaltura both allow for you to quickly build out  multimedia websites from templates and the ability to pick your video  player of choice for those sites.</p>
<p><strong><br />
In a pinch, Kaltura can also act as a Digital Asset Management solution,  supporting ingestion, transcoding and management workflows for  documents. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Features include:</strong><br />
&bull;	Document upload in multiple formats (MS Office, OpenOffice)<br />
&bull;	Conversion of documents into web friendly formats (PDF, SWF), making  them available through any browser and not limited to software  installation<br />
&bull;	Integration of documents and video into Kaltura&rsquo;s PowerPoint widget<br />
This is where the overlap ends for our use of these platforms.<br />
We are not close to having these two platforms doing all the same  things, and the languages required to modify and properly service them  is greatly different. Since it is open source there are tons of  resources available for you to dig through and troubleshoot issues  should they arise.  My dealing with the past build of Kaltura has been  that once you get the platform to a stable state, you walk away. No need  to touch it again.  You work totally within its GUI and backend  Administration area.<br />
<span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 0);"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 0);"><strong>The differences are as follows.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);">ENTERMEDIA</span></strong></p>
<p>Entermedia is JAVA based. Peter is able to administer the system in  its current state, but any further development for richer use would  require assistance from Entermedia and the rates for support are about  $20,000 for the year and go up from there. With proper resources and  dedication of time as well as some support from Entermedia, we can get  the platform to a fully functioning digital asset platform, that would  service all of Yeshiva University for its need for images, audio and  video. Peter Robertson would be better equipped to answer any other  questions you may have about service and support for Entermedia.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);">KALTURA</span></strong></p>
<p>Kaltura is PHP based but only a handful of us are capable of feeling  comfortable dealing with the code and any modification.  Kaltura seems  easier to deal with once you have become comfortable with PHP than  dealing with JAVA. The cost of running Kaltura CE (Community Edition is  the Open source version) is variable.  Hosting it with them would  immediately allow for us to get up and running and the charge would be  $299 per month and go up from there.  It can get just a pricey as  Entermedia if we host with them, but the payoff is instant.  We would  only have to worry about learning the administration of the system,  rather than building out a box and configuring it correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Detailed pricing and features can be found here:</strong> <a href="http://corp.kaltura.com/video_platform/editions_and_pricing">http://corp.kaltura.com/video_platform/editions_and_pricing</a></p>
<p>If we decide to build our own box, the costs drop dramatically.   Since it is open source, and I have built this server in an older  version, we would save money by the bucketful, but at what cost. The  downside is that we would have no support other than in house and forums  to assist with any issues we may encounter initially or in the future.  Going this way would require a commitment to time, patience and  resources. But it is possible.</p>

<p>So which one is better?&nbsp; I guess it depends on what your budget is  and what language you are comfortable using, because modification and  setup is required with both platforms.&nbsp; Tell me what you think by  posting your comments and let the battle continue.</p>
