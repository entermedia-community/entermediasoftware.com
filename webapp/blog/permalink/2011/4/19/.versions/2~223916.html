<p>Why is it a bad idea to trust a monolithic website such as, let's say, Google Video with your videos? Well, Google bought YouTube and has now made the decision to shut down Google Video.</p>
<p>On April 29th, videos on Google will no longer be available for playback. Users have until May 13th to download their videos, after that, all videos will be deleted.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be better to control the server and software you trust with your digital files? <a href="http://entermediasoftware.com">EnterMedia</a> Digital Asset Management gives you the control and ownership of your digital files!</p>
