<p>California Dreaming on a Winters Day.</p>
<p>So . . . A little blog article about the EnterMedia trip out west.&nbsp; I don't think any of us were truly looking forward to the connecting flights from Dayton International to LAX.&nbsp; I watched the midwest pass plainly below on the first flight from the last row of the plane, which I had entirely to myself.&nbsp; Something about Frontier airlines:&nbsp; Our party wasn't seated together on any of the flights.&nbsp; We had a brief lay-over in Denver, and then we headed over the Rockies, and to what we could only imagine lay beyond.&nbsp; Only Jason, from JYS Productions knew for sure as this was his fifth LA trip this year.&nbsp; After we landed we would find out that meant Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles all around, delicious! &nbsp;So, sometime late Tuesday evening we arrived LAX, which was undergoing fresh renovations. &nbsp;We were glad to be off the plane, and we made our way to Enterprise car rental to pick up our ride. &nbsp;Julie had reserved a mid-sides SUV, and we were able to upgrade to a new Jeep, all black with black tinted Windows. &nbsp;I volunteered to be designated driver, and we were off to the hotel. &nbsp;We were all getting hungry, especially Christopher, so we stopped at Roscoe's for what turned out to be some of the best food the whole trip. &nbsp;Roscoe's is world famous for their Chicken and Waffles, and so we loaded up on food, and then we loaded into the car once more, and headed on our way.</p>
<p>The Hilton at Universal city was a pretty nice four star. &nbsp;We checked into our rooms on the 18th floor and Christopher and Julie retired for the night. &nbsp;Meanwhile Jason, and I managed to deploy some renegade wi-fi, and proceeded to take some iphone and DSLR footage of us chillin' at the top of the world . . . Hollywood! &nbsp;After a dry run to make sure all of our portable technolgy was connected and fully operational, we hit the sack for an early convention the next day.</p>
<p>Jason was up, dressed to kill, and out the door first thing the next morning. &nbsp;Julie, Christopher, and Jason were off to the Create-a-sphere digital asset management convention. &nbsp;I was charged with retrieving some brochures that were ready for pick up on Santa Monica Boulevard, and so I headed out for a magical little drive through Beverly Hills. &nbsp;If you don't know, LA is the capitol of sprawl. &nbsp;There's no good way to tell how long a trip around town is going to take you, but set aside about an hour for every twenty miles as the crow flies.</p>
