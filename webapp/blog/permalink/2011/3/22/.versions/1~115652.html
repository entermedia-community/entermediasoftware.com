<p>California Dreaming on a Winters Day.</p>
<p>So . . . A little blog article about the EnterMedia trip out west.&nbsp; I don't think any of us were truly looking forward to the connecting flights from Dayton International to LAX.&nbsp; I watched the midwest pass plainly below on the first flight from the last row of the plane, which I had entirely to myself.&nbsp; Something about Frontier airlines:&nbsp; Our party wasn't seated together on any of the flights.&nbsp; We had a brief lay-over in Denver, and then we headed over the Rockies, and to what we could only imagine lay beyond.&nbsp; Only Jason, from JYS Productions knew for sure as this was his fifth LA trip this year.&nbsp; After we landed we would find out that meant Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles all around, delicious!</p>
