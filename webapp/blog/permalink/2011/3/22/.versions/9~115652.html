<h1>California Dreaming on a Winters Day</h1>
<h2>or EnterMedia Storms LA Convention, Enterprise Digital Asset Management Epicenter</h2>
<p><em>A short synopsis on a four person excursion to LA.&nbsp; We tackle the tough questions about DAM and southern Californian culture. I was there on the scene for this eyewitness report.</em></p>
<p>So . . . A little blog article about the EnterMedia trip out west.&nbsp; I don't think any of us were truly looking forward to the connecting flights from Dayton International to LAX.&nbsp; I watched the midwest pass plainly below on the first flight from the last row of the plane, which I had entirely to myself.&nbsp; Something about Frontier airlines:&nbsp; Our party wasn't seated together on any of the flights.&nbsp; We had a brief lay-over in Denver, and then we headed over the Rockies, and to what we could only imagine lay beyond.&nbsp; Only Jason, from JYS Productions knew for sure as this was his fifth LA trip this year.&nbsp; After we landed we would find out that meant Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles all around, delicious! &nbsp;So, sometime late Tuesday evening we arrived at LAX, which was undergoing fresh renovations. &nbsp;We were glad to be off the plane, and we made our way to Enterprise car rental to pick up our ride. &nbsp;Julie had reserved a mid-sized SUV, and we upgraded to a new Jeep, all black, with black tinted Windows (got tinted windows on my ride I'm inconspicuous - Outkast). &nbsp;I volunteered to be designated driver, and we were off to the hotel. &nbsp;We were all getting hungry, especially Cristopher, so we stopped at Roscoe's for what turned out to be some of the best food the whole trip. &nbsp;Roscoe's is world famous for their Chicken and Waffles, and so we loaded up on food, and then we loaded into the car once more, and made for the hotel.</p>
<p>The Hilton at Universal city was a pretty nice four star. &nbsp;We checked into our rooms on the 18th floor and Cristopher and Julie retired for the night. &nbsp;Meanwhile Jason, and I managed to deploy some renegade wi-fi, and proceeded to take some iphone and DSLR footage of us chillin' at the top of the world . . . Hollywood! &nbsp;After this quick dry run to make sure all of our portable technology was connected and fully operational, we hit the sack for an early convention the next day.</p>
<p>Jason was up, dressed to kill, and out the door first thing the next morning. &nbsp;Julie, Cristopher, and he were off to the Create-a-sphere digital asset management convention.&nbsp; Meanwhile,&nbsp; I was charged with retrieving some brochures that were ready for pick up on Santa Monica Boulevard, and so I headed out for a magical little drive through Beverly Hills.</p>
<p>If you don't know, LA is the capitol of sprawl. &nbsp;There's no good way to tell how long a trip around town is going to take you, but set aside about an hour for every twenty miles as the crow flies.</p>
<p>Ah.&nbsp; The brochures.&nbsp; Let's see.&nbsp; There was typo, and it was my fault.&nbsp; I was determined not to let it get to me.&nbsp; I guess that is what happens when you make the final edits at the last minute with 10 kids in the house.&nbsp; I should of caught it in the proof though, so I can't really blame that.&nbsp; Okay, enough self-inflicted guilt.&nbsp; Here's the brochure, they wanted me to correct it for the blog, but how is that interesting?&nbsp; Here at EnterMedia we cut through political red-tape.&nbsp; That's what makes us cool. So . . . can you find the typo?</p>

<p>&nbsp;This is where the brochure will be displayed along with PDF Download.&nbsp; Caption will read:&nbsp; We Distibute.&nbsp; It's like the next generation of Distribute, streamlined.</p>
<p>So . . . what happened next?&nbsp; Got the brochures, right.&nbsp;&nbsp; I slowly made my way back down Santa Monica Blvd in the Jeep.&nbsp; There was a notion to stop at Staples, and get a sticker to cover the typo, and I made a quick stop.&nbsp; Really though, nothing could undo the Spelling FAIL x 1,000 brochures.&nbsp; Like I said, I'm letting it go.</p>
<p>Back at the ranch, Cristopher, Julie, and Jason were chopping it up with the who's who of digital asset management software.&nbsp; Cristopher is the president of EnterMedia and a Java wizard.&nbsp; He is soft spoken and an all around good guy, friendly to be around, and the father of four awesome kids.&nbsp; You can be sure he was scoping out the competition's new features, and calculating how to implement them in his own master plan, ha, ha, ha.&nbsp; To be sure, I took his name tag during the catered lunch spectacular, and masquereded incognito as Cristopher Burkey.&nbsp; I sat down at a table labeled something like, &quot;Weirdo's at a DAM convention,&quot; and proceeded to introduce myself, and MY company EnterMedia Software.&nbsp; It was an easy sell.&nbsp; I had them literally drooling over EnterMedia enterprise server platform (actually they were eating . . . that's why they were drooling, but anyway).&nbsp; I met this nice lady who works for Ripley's Believe It or Not.&nbsp; I finished my lunch and passed the tag back to Cristopher.</p>
