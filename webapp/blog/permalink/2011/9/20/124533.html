<p>Getting ready to head to New York City for Createasphere DAM. As usual, traveling isn't so straightforward with us, taking a photo and film crew along. Yes, we are driving, we have some stops to make along the way and carrying a lot of equipment, plus we get grumpy thinking about flying into - out of LGA! Have slept on their lovely marble floors more than once, no more of that.</p>
<p>First stop, a remote cabin owned by a photographer who travels the world doing photo shoots. Unfortunately, we will miss her, she's traveling to Zion National Park and the Adirondacks this week.</p>
