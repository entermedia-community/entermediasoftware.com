<p><a href="http://www.entermediasoftware.com">EnterMedia</a>&nbsp;has formally released version 8.0 of EnterMedia Digital Asset Management. Version 8.0 was developed in part while working with Harvard Business School and South Dakota State University. New features were designed to meet the high performance requirements of the university faculty and the student body. EnterMedia 8.0 handles larger uploading capacity, simultaneous uploading capabilities, increased power proficiency and server clustering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this new release came two big features Harvard needed based on their high performance requirements for video and digital files. They wanted the ability to deal with over 600 simultaneous uploads, along with the capacity to encode large video files on their server. We also added clustering, a very unique feature to Digital Asset Management software, which allows three servers to be working as one machine. It allows the capability to build large websites like YouTube or Flickr,&rdquo; said Christopher Burkey, CEO and creator of EnterMedia. &ldquo;The power of EnterMedia has increased substantially.&quot;</p>
<p>EnterMedia 8.0 now provides quicker access to related assets, recent uploads, and featured content. The visual layout of asset presentation has been improved, buttons and features are arranged more intuitively. In addition, the search process is more customizable than ever before with user specific arrangement of metadata columns and categories.</p>
<p>With EnterMedia 8.0, we have introduced a solution that addresses the majority of the markets needs. This version is the culmination of over ten years of consulting in the Digital Asset Management arena. Our code has evolved, and we have developed it into a platform that meets the complex requirements and standards of an enterprise level server at an economical cost.</p>
