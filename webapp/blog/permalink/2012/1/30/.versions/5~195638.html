<p><a href="http://www.entermediasoftware.com">EnterMedia</a> has formally released version 8.0 of EnterMedia Open Source Digital Asset Management. Version 8.0 was developed while working with Harvard Business School and South Dakota State University, the new features were designed to meet the high performance requirements of the universities student body. EnterMedia 8.0 handles larger uploading capacity, simultaneous uploading capabilities, increased power proficiency and computer clustering.</p>
<p>EnterMedia 8.0 now provides quicker access to related assets, recent uploads, and featured content. The visual layout of asset presentation has been improved, buttons and features are arranged more intuitively. In addition, the search process is more customizable than ever before with user specific arrangement of metadata columns and categories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this new release came two big features Harvard needed based on their high performance requirements for video and other digital files. They wanted the ability to deal with over 600 simultaneous uploads, along with the capacity to encode large video files on their server. We also added clustering, a very unique feature to Digital Asset Management software, which allows three computers to be working as one machine. It allows the capability to build large websites like YouTube or Flickr,&rdquo; said Christopher Burkey, CEO and creator of EnterMedia. &ldquo;The power of EnterMedia has increased substantially.&rdquo;</p>
