<br />
It's  hard to believe that we are approaching the end of another year. 2010  brought many exciting changes to EnterMedia! We began the year as  OpenEdit but formerly changed our name to EnterMedia, to better reflect  what our software does. New offices, partnerships, employees, clients,  and a new website are some of the other changes that round off our year.<br />
<br />
Most  importantly, <a href="http://www.entermediasoftware.com">EnterMedia Digital Asset Management</a> has continued to  mature into an enterprise distribution and publishing workflow for  digital files of all kinds. As video continues to grow in the  marketplace, we have added features to EnterMedia to support our clients  video and film needs. Here is a list of all our <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;" shape="rect" href="http://entermediasoftware.com/releasenotes.html" target="_blank">EnterMedia Release Notes for 2010.</a><br />
<br />
We thank you for your support this past year and look forward to working with you in 2011.<br />
<br />
Seasons Greetings from all of us at EnterMedia!<br />
