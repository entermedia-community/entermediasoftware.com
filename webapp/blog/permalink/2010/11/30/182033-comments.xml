I just noticed that the number of comments didn't update on my last post.&amp;nbsp; This is definitely a job for the issue tracker.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Also, still haven't talked to Chris since he left yesterday.&amp;nbsp; He should be in Chile by now.&amp;nbsp; I hope everything is going smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
