			<h2>The Open Source Philosophy</h2>
		</hgroup>
		<aside class="breakout">
			There are many popular open source software programs on the market today. From OpenOffice, which is handy replacement for Microsoft&#39;s Office suite, to Linux, which is a full blown operating system, open source is a fantastic alternative to propriety software. Having the source code freely available encourages collaboration and development among a greater population of software engineers. Ultimately this leads to a community developers who can create a variety of applications based off the original code and this extends the features of the original platform.
		</aside>
		<section>
			<p>
				The implications of a community of a developers working to enhance EnterMedia range from third party extensions to custom connectors to other systems. Propriety software, on the other hand, seems too restrictive with the end-users left waiting and hoping that their feature request will be addressed in upcoming releases. Having the source code openly available gives our clients more flexibility to design and implement a system that addresses their particular requirements.
			</p>
			<p>
				With over ten years developing digital asset management technologies, we have noticed that clients appreciate being able to take a more active role in development which is exactly what "open-source," entails. At the same time, in our latest release of EnterMedia we have included all of the most frequently requested features right out of the box.
