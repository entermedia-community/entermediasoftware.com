	<h2>
		The Open Source Philosophy</h2>
	</hgroup> <aside class="breakout"> There are many popular open source software programs on the market today. From OpenOffice, which is handy replacement for Microsoft's Office suite, to Linux, a full blown operating system; open source is a fantastic alternative to propriety software. Having the source code freely available encourages collaboration and development among a greater population of software engineers. Ultimately this leads to a community of developers who can create a variety of applications based off the original code and extends the features of the original platform. </aside> <section>
	<p>
		The implications of a community of developers working to enhance EnterMedia range from third party extensions to custom connectors from other systems. Propriety software, on the other hand, seems too restrictive with the end-users left waiting and hoping that their feature request will be addressed in upcoming releases. Having the source code openly available gives our clients more flexibility to design and implement a system that addresses their particular requirements.</p>
	<p>
		With over ten years developing digital asset management technologies, we know that some clients appreciate being able to take a more active role in development which is exactly what "open-source," entails. At the same time, other clients are looking for an "out of the box solution, which is why we have included all of the most frequently requested features&nbsp;in our latest release of EnterMedia - right out of the box.</p>

	<p>
		Our Mash Up installation is the perfect way for developers to access our source code, so they can see first hand the potential power of the EnterMedia digital asset management system. EnterMedia is open source so the code is freely available and we want to do our best to encourage development by interested parties.</p>
