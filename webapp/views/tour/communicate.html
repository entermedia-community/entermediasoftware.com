            <span>Powerful commenting made easy.</span>
Built-in commenting in EnterMedia makes taking notes a cinch without obstructing your natural work-flow.  This makes it easy for you to clear up any questions your client or team might have, AND since comments are stored with the original asset, everyone knows where to go for the latest information.

            <span>Geo-tag your assets.</span>
					EnterMedia is a powerful metadata editor.  With the geo-tagging feature, you can search by zip code, and quickly give your asset latitude and longitude.  That information is bundled with the asset when people view it later.</p>

            <span>Easily attach and send files by email.</span>
					
EnterMedia makes it easy to share files with colleagues across departments without losing track of data.  It automatically writes a generic email for you and includes the appropriate links for the files you have selected.  Easily customize what size or type of file to send. </p>

            <span>Track file usage and history.</span>
            
            Every file action that takes place on your server is recorded and attached to your asset through the system.  You can get a read out of users and see the file actions they performed with a time record.
