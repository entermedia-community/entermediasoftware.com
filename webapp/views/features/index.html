		<strong> In EnterMedia "applications," form the core</strong> of the installation and in addition to that you can add extensible applications. With EnterMedia 8 we finally have an out of the box solution that addresses most of our customers needs. After over 10 years of consulting in the Digital Asset Management arena we have developed a platform that addresses the variety of tasks required for an enterprise level server.

	<section class="columns-2">
		<p>
			EnterMedia 8 ships with three applications that form the core of your installation. Library, Share, and Manager. Library is the behemoth. We have robust metadata tables that enable you to quickly find the media you are looking for. Share is like a light weight version of Library. It helps you set up a new website quickly so you can share your media easily. Manager lets you control the infrastructure of your installation, adding catalogs and creating new instances easily.
		</p>
		<p>
			What EnterMedia 8 does is consolidate our past ten years of private consulting services where we have customized our installations to the clients specifications. Since then, we have addressed so many things, but there has been some overlap. We have taken those features that are the most commonly requested, and built a release around it, and we think you are going to enjoy using it.

			<h5> Enterprise Media Library (EML)</h5>
			<p>
				The Enterprise Media Library application is where you manage your assets, and it is feature packed to aid you in administration. You can setup permissions and enable security to control your content. You can search for media and edit metadata at the deepest levels. A lot of companies come to us asking how much it will cost to expand their installation, and many times they don&#39;t realize they have those capabilities already. We have a new user interface that makes EML easy and pleasant to work with. Library is robust organizing tool, and the best way to learn more about it is to contact us.

Share looks like a website. You can change your logo, you can change the color scheme. So, you can make it your own. It allows people to comment, share to Facebook, upload, view assets in galleries, and play videos.
